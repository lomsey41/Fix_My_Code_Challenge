# Fix My Code Challenge


Fix my code is a new type of project, where i  jumped  into an existing code base and fix it! This is done using pre-written repos as initial files for all solutions. I did  not code  anything new, just fixing the existing code base.

This was a project provided by ALX in which I was challenged with debugging various programs. The challenges spanned a variety of programming languages from C to Python to Javascript to Ruby and more, some of which I was familiar with, others of which I was not.
